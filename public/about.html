<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings! I am Dale "Dalton" James and I am an aspiring Developer.</p>

<p>Why do I love Development? 
  I love it because I love the way that code somthing that many humans dont understand can come to life to make something beautiful that everyone understands. 
  I love watching my hard work come to life.</p>
